# Matching-Pennies

Text based game created for Software Development Methods Assesment at Edinburgh Naiper University.

## Program Description
The game “Matching pennies” is played by a human and a computer player, taking turns.
It is a game played between two players, Even and Odd. Each player has a penny and
must secretly turn the penny to heads or tails. The players then reveal their choices
simultaneously. If the pennies match (both heads or both tails), then Even keeps both
pennies, so wins one from Odd (+1 for Even, -1 for Odd). If the pennies do not match
(one heads and one tails) Odd keeps both pennies, so receives one from Even (-1 for
Even, +1 for Odd)
